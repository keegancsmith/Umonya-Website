As part of an ongiong effort to assist learners, the set of notes used throughout the workshop is publicly avaliable and can be found [here|http://umonya.co.za/pb/]. Later workshops will make use of a new set of notes which volunteers are currently hard at work writing. If you feel that you could make a contribution to this effort through any means, please contact us at admins@umonya.co.za. Upon completion, the new notes will similarly be made avaliable _here_.

If you have any further questions about the course, you can join us on  #algorithm on Shadowfire [link to mibbit], an active IRC channel which discusses programming, algorithms and related topics.

In line with our larger goals, we also aim to help eager learners to run programming clubs at their schools. Watch this space for supporting resources and further updates.
