The course notes we are using are available [here|http://umonya.co.za/pb/]. We are rewriting a new textbook from scratch, written specifically with Umonya in mind. Here's how to get involved in helping us write the book. It will be posted here when it reaches a publishable state.

We will also be posting resources for clubs here.

IRC, forums, etc.
