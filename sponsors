As a volunteer project, Umonya is largely dependant on the kind and generous efforts of two main groups: our sponsors and our collaborators. These two groups make our workshops  possible either through fiscal means or by the extension of key resources.

There are many facets of a single Umonya workshop and so we are always on the look out for more sponsors. Whether you are a willing to sponsor a nearby workshop or simply able to provide assistance with food, administration or anything else, please don't hesitate to contact us [link]. Furthermore, we are always open to collaboration with other groups undertaking similar efforts. If you are involved with such a project, we would love to hear from you [link].
