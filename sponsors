More sponsors = more workshops and other crap
plox sponsor, kthnxbai
Even as simple as a foodstuffs discount, make funds we have do more/further
Always looking for more collab to reduce dup of effort and take adv. of diversity of
skills that other initiatives can bring
Local company can sponsor loca workshop

We fail at township, SAILI do this anyway, so we may as well work together
SC are trying to do what we do, but dont have time, but we don't have resc. together = better

If you are interested in collaborating with Umonya: link


!!!
As a volunteer project, Umonya is largely dependant on the kind and generous efforts of two main groups:
our sponsors and our collaborators. These two groups make our workshops possible either through fiscal means or
by the extension of key resources.
