Workshops are run over a full weekend and are divided between lectures and practical sessions with lunch time providing an opportunity for our sponsors to provide insight into the programming industry. Lecturers will lead each session, demonstrating concepts and elaborating on the content of the notes with tutors available throughout for help on any problems that may be encountered.
