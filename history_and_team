Umonya was born out of the UCT Algorithm Circle [link to website]. We began by introducing the Python programming language to a small group of learners from the UCT Maths Circle, who found the course immensely enjoyable. This first success prompted us to reach out to a larger number of learners; we decided to venture into new terrain and advertise to all schools in Cape Town.

A week later we had received over a hundred applications from thirty schools. The response exceeded even our most abmitious expectations, and as such we had to limit our acceptance to fourty-five students. The response to this pilot was phenominal. The learners performed exceptionally under the guidance of their student tutors, who took great pleasure in the learners' progress. By the end of the workshop, attendees with no prior experience were able to write fully functioning programmes.

Following the succes of the pilot, we quickly realised the potential of Project Umonya and organised larger workshops in Cape Town and Stellenbosch. As part of its CS4HS initiative <link>, Google later awarded us funding to extend the reach of the project beyond the borders of the Western Cape. We have since grown from the initial ten volunteers to the full spectrum listed below:
