Over the course of a fun-filled weekend, Umonya introduces computer programming to hundreds of school learners of all backgrounds with the help of passionate volunteers. Computer programming is a way to instruct a computer to do things for you. Learners need no prior programming experience to attend.
We hold workshops throughout South Africa using the free and widely used Python programming language.
If you are interested in attending a workshop, you can apply _here_. It's free and it's fun.
