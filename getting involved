Volunteering for Umonya:
------------------------
The success of Umonya depends a wide spectrum of volunteers. If you are a competent* programmer, consider volunteering as a tutor. Tutors engage with participants on a one-to-one basis in order to help solidify their understanding of lecture topics. You may also wish to help with the writing of workshop coursework, or with website design and maintenance.

However, you do not need to be an experienced programmer to help, as we require assistance with adminstrative tasks such as: coordinating volunteers, transport, catering, advertising, accounting, liasing with various universities, and coordinating sponsorship.

/*
There are many facets to the running and execution of a successful Umonya workshop and so we always welcome new volunteers. 

Tutors, lecturers, video streaming, website design and maintenance, writing textbooks,
admin/organisation: coordinating volunteers, transport & catering, media relations/advertising, accountant, university liason, finding sponsors, t-shirts/misc., email queries
