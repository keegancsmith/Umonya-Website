    <h2>Who we are</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        We are a group of experienced programmers who are enthusiastic about
        computer programming. It was from this enthusiasm that the idea of
        Umonya was born, with the goal of introducing the endless
        possibilities afforded by computer programming to learners, in free
        workshops.
      </p>

      <p>
        Information Technology (IT) has become integral to many fields in the
        modern world: academia, commerce and industry all require IT at
        fundamental level to function efficiently. Unfortunately, not everyone
        has had the opportunity to develop advanced IT skills, such as
        computer programming. Through a collaborative effort, Umonya workshops
        teach programming to those who have not yet had such an opportunity,
        through the medium of the <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>
        language.
      </p>

      <p>
        We don't teach leaners how to <strong>use</strong> software; we teach them how to
        <strong>make</strong> software. For example, a participant should be
        able use a web browser; we will teach the skills, which, if developed,
        will enable them to write one. We do not intend to replace South
        African IT curricula; rather, we offer a distinct means for learners
        to discover what programming has to offer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Umonya aims to make learning programming free and fun -- if you do not
        have fun, we offer a double-your-money-back guarentee.
